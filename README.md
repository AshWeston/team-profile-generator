# TEAM PROFILE GENERATOR

[![npm](https://badge.fury.io/js/inquirer.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/inquirer)

## Description

This project was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing for each part of the code was completed using Jest to ensure each test passed.

This application uses Jest for running the unit tests and Inquirer for collecting input from the user. When prompted for information, an HTML is generated based on the user input that displays a nicely formatted team roster. The application will be invoked by using the following command: `node index.js`
